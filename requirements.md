## 1. User Authentication

### API Endpoints
```http
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
GET  /api/auth/me
POST /api/auth/logout
```

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Register/Login:** Accepts JSON with `email`, `password`, `name`.  
- **Output:** Returns JWT token and user profile.

### Validation Rules
- Email must be valid and unique.  
- Password must have at least 8 characters.  
- Name must not exceed 50 characters.

### Performance Criteria
- Registration and login should respond within **300ms**.  
- Concurrent logins: Support up to **10,000 users** simultaneously.

### Security Considerations
- Store passwords using **bcrypt hashing**.  
- Implement **JWT-based authentication** with token expiration.  
- Enforce **rate limiting** for login attempts.

## 2. Property Management

### API Endpoints
```http
POST   /api/properties
GET    /api/properties
GET    /api/properties/{id}
PUT    /api/properties/{id}
DELETE /api/properties/{id}
```

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Create Property:** Requires `title`, `description`, `price`, `location`, and optional images.  
- **Output:** Returns property ID and stored data.

### Validation Rules
- Price must be numeric and greater than zero.  
- Title must be 5–100 characters.  
- Images must be in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.webp` format.

### Performance Criteria
- Must handle **1,000+ property listings per second**.  
- Response time: < 500ms for listing retrieval.

### Security Considerations
- Only authenticated users can create/edit/delete properties.  
- Validate ownership before updates or deletions.

## 3. Booking System

### API Endpoints
```http
POST   /api/bookings
GET    /api/bookings/{id}
PUT    /api/bookings/{id}/cancel
GET    /api/bookings/user/{userId}
```

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Create Booking:** Requires `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `guests`.  
- **Output:** Returns booking confirmation with total price.

### Validation Rules
- Check-in date must be in the future.  
- Check-out date must be after check-in.  
- Guests must not exceed property capacity.

### Performance Criteria
- Booking confirmation must be processed within **1 second**.  
- Support **real-time availability updates**.

### Security Considerations
- Prevent double bookings via **atomic transactions**.  
- Ensure only property owners or booking users can modify/cancel.

## 4. Payment System

### API Endpoints
```http
POST   /api/payments
GET    /api/payments/{id}
POST   /api/payments/refund
```

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Create Payment:** Accepts booking ID and payment method.  
- **Output:** Payment receipt, transaction ID, and status.

### Validation Rules
- Payment amount must match booking total.  
- Only valid and active bookings can be paid.

### Performance Criteria
- Payment processing should complete in **≤2 seconds**.  
- Must support **secure third-party gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)**.

### Security Considerations
- Use **PCI-DSS-compliant processing**.  
- Encrypt sensitive payment details with **AES-256**.  
- Support **webhook validation** for payment confirmations.

## 5. Review & Rating System

### API Endpoints
```http
POST   /api/reviews
GET    /api/reviews/property/{propertyId}
PUT    /api/reviews/{id}
DELETE /api/reviews/{id}
```

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Create Review:** Requires `rating (1–5)`, `comment`, and `property_id`.  
- **Output:** Returns review ID and average property rating.

### Validation Rules
- Users can only review properties they have booked.  
- Rating must be an integer between 1 and 5.

### Performance Criteria
- Reviews should update average rating in **real-time**.  
- Handle **up to 10,000 reviews per hour**.

### Security Considerations
- Prevent spam by limiting one review per booking.  
- Authenticate review ownership for edits/deletions.

## General Security Considerations
- **Data encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)** and at rest.  
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for admin and users.  
- **SQL Injection and XSS prevention** via input sanitization.  
- **Rate limiting & API throttling** to prevent abuse.  
- **Audit logging** for sensitive operations (payments, cancellations, edits).
